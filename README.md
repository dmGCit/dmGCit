- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmGCit - Dave Evans, age 71, doing real world programming (i.e., solving other people's problems) since 1969.
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out the best way to edit, probably from the bash that was installed when I downloaded git on my pc
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and wiki
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (too soon to tell)
- 📫 Reach me at my personal email: dmsirius@gmail.com
